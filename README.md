# 🚉 Train Platform Allocation System

This project demonstrates a Train Platform Allocation System built using C++.  
It assigns platforms to trains based on their arrival and departure times, ensuring that no two trains use the same platform at the same time — helping optimize railway operations.

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| train.cpp| C++ implementation of the train platform allocation logic |

## 🚀 Features

- 🛬 Takes multiple train arrival and departure times  
- 🏗️ Allocates platforms dynamically to avoid conflicts  
- 📊 Uses efficient data structures (e.g., priority queue)  
- ⚡ Calculates the minimum number of platforms required  
- 💻 User-friendly terminal-based interface  

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Compile the program** using a C++ compiler:  
   ```bash
   g++ train.cpp -o train
